  ? 'appl_YOUR_SANDBOX_KEY_HERE' 
  : 'appl_YOUR_PRODUCTION_KEY_HERE';
```

## ï¿½ï¿½ Premium Features

All features require either an active trial, subscription, or lifetime access:

- âœ… **Card Analysis** - Professional centering measurement tools
- âœ… **Export Analysis Images** - Download analysis results to photo library
- âœ… **Unlimited Analyses** - No limits on number of card analyses

3. **Post-Trial**: Must subscribe or purchase to continue
4. **No Free Tier**: App requires active subscription for all features

## ðŸ§ª Development Testing

During development, the app uses AsyncStorage to simulate subscription states:

- Free trial can be started without RevenueCat
- Subscription status is persisted locally
- Premium features can be tested without real purchases

To enable real RevenueCat testing, set `TEST_WITH_REVENUECAT = true` in `SubscriptionContext.tsx`.

## ðŸ“± App Store Review

When submitting to App Store:

1. Ensure subscription terms are clearly displayed
2. Include privacy policy link
3. Test restore purchases functionality
4. Verify subscription management works correctly

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Products not loading**: Ensure product IDs match exactly between App Store Connect and RevenueCat
2. **Sandbox testing fails**: Make sure you're signed in with a sandbox test user
3. **Restore purchases not working**: Check that entitlements are properly configured

### Debug Logs

Enable debug logging in development:

```typescript
if (__DEV__) {
  await Purchases.setLogLevel(LOG_LEVEL.DEBUG);
}
```

This will show detailed RevenueCat logs in your console to help debug issues.
